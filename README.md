File name: Shopping_list.java

magine you're running a little program that helps you create a shopping list. That's what this Java code does!
 
First, it sets up a "list" that can hold up to 5 things you want to buy. Think of it like having 5 empty slots ready to be filled.
 
Then, the program asks you, "Hey, what do you need to buy?". You type in an item, and it puts that item into one of the slots in the list. It keeps asking you until you've entered 5 items, or until you say "no, I'm done adding items".
 
Once you're done entering items, the program shows you your complete shopping list, all neatly displayed. It also tells you how many items you've added.
 
And there's a bonus feature! The program can also search for a specific item in your list. You type in what you're looking for, and it tells you whether that item is on your shopping list or not.
 
So, it's a simple but helpful program to keep track of the things you need to buy! It's like a digital version of writing a shopping list on a piece of paper.
